How long did you spend working on this project?

It's taken me about two days.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Getting the Transaction class to work, because the interaction between multiple classes is still difficult for me to put into practice.

What two additional features did you build? Why?

I added a total_purchases method that outputs how many purchases a customer has made and how much money they've spent, which could be used to implement some kind of customer loyalty program in the future. I also added the ability to buy different quantities of a product in a single transaction to make purchasing easier.

Where do you still have room to grow?

I still have a lot of growth to do with understanding programming logic (especially with OOP) and with learning to make the most of the tools available.
